# Draft Post Dislaimer

## About
This plugin is based on work by [Sal Ferrarello](https://salferrarello.com/draft-blog-posts/). The idea being to publish draft posts in a new category and add a disclaimer. This reduces the barrier to getting posts published but lets people know that the post is a work in progress.

###TODO:

 - Remove from Feed? (Make this an option)
 - Turn the remove from home page into an option
 - Fix depreciated static method call (what????)
 - Turn category select into a drop down
 - Add span/div to front page to display a "Draft" flag if front page display is enabled
 - Add a bit more to documentation
 - Add draft category on init?
